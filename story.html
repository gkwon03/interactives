            A new wave of Avian Influenza, sometimes known as bird flu, is sweeping the world, causing new fears among public health officials because the outbreak threatens not just bird populations, but also mammals and humans. 
        </p>

        <h2>A Migratory Virus</h2>
        <p>
            In 1996, the H5N1 subtype of the highly pathogenic influenza A virus was discovered in domestic geese in China. With the exception of Australia, almost every continent has been impacted by the most recent surge from 2020 to 2025 has been among the worst. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The virus primarily spreads through migratory birds, which can carry the pathogen across vast distances, infecting poultry farms along the way. 
            The economic toll has evidently been staggering, with millions of birds having to be culled in attempts to contain the spread. 
            Egg prices, for example, have soared by a noticeable $3 between December 2024 and February 2025 as the poultry industry continues to struggle with supply chain disruptions.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Growing Threat</h2>
        <p>
            This outbreak is especially alarming because it has not only affected birds. 
            In the United States (U.S.), H5N1 cases were found in dairy cows earlier this year, a worrying development that prompted increased surveillance and stricter biosecurity measures. 
            Furthermore, from foxes and seals to domestic cats, this virus is infecting numerous new hosts, which raises concerns about its adaptability. 
            The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has even gone so far as issuing a recall on certain raw pet food products due to potential contamination.
        </p>
        <p>
            Public health officials continue to monitor the situation closely. 
            While the virus does not easily spread to or between people, past outbreaks show that it is possible to wreak havoc directly. 
            The 1997 Hong Kong outbreak, for example, led to 18 human infections and six deaths.
                    
        </p>

        <h2>Monitoring the Spread</h2>
        <p>
            Visualizing the outbreak’s trajectory is crucial for understanding and thereby reducing its impact. 
            This chart visualizes the number of cases reported by specific bird species in the last year.

        <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
        <p>
            Efforts to contain the virus continue with actions like poultry vaccinations gaining traction. 
            The U.S. Department of Agriculture has even launched a $1 billion initiative to combat the outbreak, but many are skeptical about the best long-term solution. 
            With wild birds acting as hosts for the virus, complete eradication may be impossible to achieve, but that does not mean strengthening surveillance, improving biosecurity measures, and advancing vaccine research could help curb future outbreaks before they spiral out of control.
        </p>
        <p>
            For now, the world watches closely as avian flu remains a threat that scientists, farmers, and policymakers must race to get in front of.
