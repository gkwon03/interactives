          Reflection
      </h3>
      This embedded playlist was super easy to use, and I could see myself using it again.
      I think it is an effective tool for giving a brief introduction to artists that many people may not know. 
      Perhaps the reader will interact with the feature and leave with new favorite songs.
      It is a great tool for giving all the information in one spot to make it easy for the reader.
      Context makes all the difference in keeping readers engaged, so this interactive tool is definitely helpful.

            Reflection
        </h3>
        This SoundCite tool was super difficult for me to figure out. 
        The main issue was with getting the URL of the song to work correctly on the Knight Lab website because I didn't really understand how to publish it online. 
        Once I got it embedded though, I like that it emphasizes the song title, and you can therefore listen to a brief snippet of the song I am directly mentioning.
        Much like the embedded playlist above, I like that this tool provides necessary context to readers in one place. 
        Furthermore, it invites the reader to participate in the story.
        Now that I know how to use the tool, I definitely think it can be powerful if used in appropriate circumstances, but I could see myself revisiting this tool.

          The Beatles

        The Beatles won Best Rock Performance for their song "Now and Then." 
        However, this song made history in a different way as well.

        This award marks the first winner to use artificial intelligence in their song. 
        The late Lennon's voice was extracted from a demo dating back to the 1970s and then incorporated into the newer version of the single.

        Read more about how this song was created in the timeline below.

      <p>With this, the group pushes the norm of music, opening the door to other similar uses of artifical intelligence for other artists moving forward.</p>

            Reflection
        </h3>
        This timeline tool was a lot of work behind the scenes in order to produce the timeline, but in the end, I am happy with the final product.
        I like that the timeline flows smoothly and, again, invites the reader to participate and engage in the piece.
        I had trouble with finding specific dates and sometimes the information would be framed as "late 1970s," but the timeline won't accept this format (at least not the template I used).
        If I really needed a timeline, I would use this tool. 
        However, if there was a better way to visualize this information, I would probably choose to explore other tools.
        In short, this timeline is great, but it required extensive research and effort behind-the-scenes for the one tool.
