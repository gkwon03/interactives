        <h3>Content plan:</h3>

        <p id="content-plan">
            I have been passionate about journalism ever since I first joined my high school newspaper staff my freshman year. 
            While this passion has evolved from reporting to designing, my passion for storytelling still goes strong. 
            In fact, only recently, I had an epiphany. 
            With a journalism major, data science minor, and design certificate defining my college career, I often worried that this was a strange combination of interests.
            However, the underlying theme here became clear to me at a networking event with leaders in the design industry. 
            All three of my interests share a core value: storytelling. 
            Therefore, since this revelation, I have never been more sure about what I want to pursue in the future.
            Ideally, I would like to design for publications. 
            Whether this means print or digital, I just want to be a graphic designer who is able to hook and guide readers into the story.

            With this portfolio, I hope to not only demonstrate my skills in HTML but also practice and experiment as I create it. 
            As part of the Segal design certificate, I am already workshopping a digital portfolio that showcases my writing and designs in hopes of getting an internship this coming summer.
            While I could have created this as part of my existing site, I chose to make this entirely from scratch to push myself to learn more about HTML. 
            I do plan on incorporating this into my other portfolio, but I want to learn the skills and become comfortable with it before including it.

           To support my goals, I hope to incorporate interactive visualizations, embedded audio and video to keep readers engaged, and in-depth storytelling accompanied with a clean design.
