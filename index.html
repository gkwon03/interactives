        With fashion trends rapidly coming in and out of style, the clothing production struggles to keep up. While the fast fashion market appeals to these rapid fads, the impact it has on the environment and minority communities poses numerous dangers.

        According to <a href="https://earth.org/fast-fashion-statistics/">Earth.Org</a>—a leading environmental news website dedicated to covering issues affecting our planet–consumers discard tons and tons of clothes. This then leads to half a million tons of microplastics ending up in oceans and toxic chemicals contaminating copious amounts of water. In short, the fast fashion is one of the biggest polluters in the world.

        However, this effect is disproportionate among communities.

        According to <a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/news/articles/2022/the-aftermath-of-fast-fashion-how-discarded-clothes-impact-public-health-and-the-environment/">Boston University's School of Public Health</a>, landfills are nearly three times more likely to be found in neighborhoods with a larger percentage of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) residents.

        Ultimately, "recycled" textiles are shipped abroad, largely in the Global South, where they land in landfills. These countries often have less advanced municipal waste systems, meaning the environmental damage and health impacts of decomposing textiles is much greater there than they would be in the United States.
