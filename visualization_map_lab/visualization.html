            Every month of 2024, <b>Harold Washington Library Center</b> evidently had the most computer sessions out of the entire Chicago Public Library system. 
            While the number of sessions steadily increased throughout the year, Harold Washington peaked in October before dropping way down in December though this drop is still greater than other libraries.
