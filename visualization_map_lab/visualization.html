            Every month of 2024, <b>Harold Washington Library Center</b> evidently had the most computer sessions out of the entire Chicago Public Library system. 
            While the number of sessions steadily increased throughout the year, Harold Washington peaked in October before dropping way down in December though this drop is still greater than other libraries.

            Given historical data of rat sightings in Chicago, 2014 surprisingly had the fewest rat sightings, but this is disproportionately seen across community areas.
            <b>Avondale</b> and <b>Garfield Park</b> in particular had the most with roughly 14,500 rat sightings that year.
            
            <p> Over a decade later, these rodent scares continue to rise.</p>
