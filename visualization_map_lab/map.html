            Given historical data of rat sightings in Chicago, 2014 surprisingly had the fewest rat sightings, but this is disproportionately seen across community areas.
            <b>Avondale</b> and <b>Garfield Park</b> in particular had the most with roughly 14,500 rat sightings that year.
            
            <p> Over a decade later, these rodent scares continue to rise.</p>
