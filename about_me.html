        <h3>Academics</h3>
        <p>
            As I mentioned earlier, I am a third-year at Northwestern University majoring in journalism, minoring in data science, and pursuing the Segal design certificate.
            I am on track to graduate December 2025, and I was recently accepted into Medill's master's program with a specialization in Media Management & Leadership.

        </p>

        <h3> Work Experience</h3>
        <p>
            In short, I have had numerous opportunities in diverse fields, allowing me to pursue different interests.

        <h3>Personal Life</h3>

        <p> 
            Outside of school and work, I am most likely cooking, listening to music, or watching Netflix's latest trashy reality show. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to think I have a diverse music taste as I am open to broadening my horizons. 
            See what I am listening to right now:
